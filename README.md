$ cd pcars2
# Install with pip
$ pip install .
```

## Quickstart

```python
from pcars.stream import PCarsStreamReceiver

class MyPCarsListener(object):
    def handlePacket(self, data):
        # You probably want to do something more exciting here
        # You probably also want to switch on data.packetType
        # See listings in packet.py for packet types and available fields for each
        print(data)


listener = MyPCarsListener()
stream = PCarsStreamReceiver()
stream.addListener(listener)
stream.run()
```
